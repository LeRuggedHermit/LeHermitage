# Hi! Welcome to my page!
## I am Le Rugged Hermit (or Simon).
**About me:** I am a Fullstack developer with a degree from the mid sweden university in Sundsvall. After two years at university where this github has been used mainly to upload various projects made for school I am now about to start using this 
for a bit more **Personal** projects.

>*For instance im currently working on a media-player that is going to be used on a website im building for a band.*  

The languages and techniques i use on my projects are (among others):
* HTML
* CSS
* Super-sets such as SCSS, SASS, LESS and so on.
* JavaScript
* Node
* PHP
* Related frameworks for front- and backend such as: Vue.JS, express.JS and Laravel
* CSS-frameworks such as Bootstrap, Tailwind and Material
* C#
* .NET (core, ASPnet core, Entitiy framework, MVC, Razor, Blazor and so on)
* SQL
* And just genereally how to design and work with databases - I usually use MySQL or MongoDB depending on need.
* Python (though i have yet to share any projects here!

I am terrible at introductions so i hope this is fine. 

**Thats all folks, Bye!**
