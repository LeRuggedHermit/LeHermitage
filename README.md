# Hi! Welcome to my page!
## I am Le Rugged Hermit or Simon.
**About me:** I am a web-developer-in-development by which I mean i study web-development at a university.
I've had this page for a little while, allthough i haven't really done any thing with it. 
currently we (my fellow class-mates and i) are at a point in our training where git-hub will be used.

>*I am exetremely happy to finally be allowed to do a bit more backend as that is the type of developement I am most attracted to.
having fallen in love with dev-work through python.*  

Among the things I'm currently learning to use are:
* PHP
* SQL
* And just genereally how to design and work with databases.

I am terrible at introductions so i hope this is fine.
